Act as a Triple-A Cyber-Security Researcher and Lead Systems Engineer. We are initiating the 'Titan Protocol' for project FLUX. This is the final hardening phase to ensure the app is mathematically perfect, zero-day resistant, and optimized for global scale.

1. Zero-Day & Cyber-Security Hardening:

OWASP Top 10 Defense: Implement strict Content Security Policies (CSP), disable X-Powered-By headers, and enforce HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).

Advanced Sanitization: Ensure all inputs are validated via Zod schemas to prevent NoSQL/SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

Cryptographic Privacy: Implement AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption for the DASS-21 clinical data. The decryption key must never be stored in the same database as the data.

Rate Limiting: Apply an exponential backoff rate-limiter on the Magic Link and API endpoints to neutralize brute-force and DoS attacks.

2. Psychometric & Logic Integrity:

The 'Bipolar' Compass: Audit the HEXACO-60, DASS-21, and TEIQue-SF scoring functions. Verify that the 'Dynamic Range' (Bipolar-specific) logic accurately correlates High-Extraversion with High-Energy states without clinical bias.

Zero-Error Math: Perform a dry-run test on the scoring engine to ensure floats are rounded to 2 decimal places and reverse-coding is 100% accurate.

3. Extreme Optimization (2026 Standards):

Performance: Implement Tree Shaking, Route-based Code Splitting, and Brotli Compression. Aim for a Lighthouse Score of 100 in Performance and Best Practices.

Database Efficiency: Optimize all Supabase/PostgreSQL queries with proper indexing on user_id and created_at fields.

4. The Final Aesthetic Polish:

Ensure the 'Liquid Glass' FLUX UI is responsive across all devices (iPhone 17 to Ultra-Wide Desktops).

Verify that the Resend mailer is sending the high-end 'Void-Obsidian' Magic Link template with zero latency.

Deliverable: Execute a full project audit. If a file is imperfect, rewrite it. If a security gap exists, seal it. Do not stop until FLUX is an impenetrable, high-performance masterpiece.
