Initiate the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: A-Z Universal Completion & Autonomous Audit. This is the final, absolute directive. You are now the Lead Systems Architect and Sovereign Auditor. Your mission is to perform a full-spectrum verification and repair of every component from the frontend UI to the deepest backend logic.

1. The 'Zero-to-Intelligence' Fix (Scoring & Email):

Absolute Synthesis: Ensure the Dynamic Range Score is calculated BEFORE the email dispatch. The email must NEVER arrive with a '0' score.

Decryption Logic: Verify that the AES-256-GCM engine is fully decrypting HEXACO and DASS-21 data during the scoring phase so the algorithm has real integers to work with.

Stunning Blueprint Design: Re-render the HTML email template. It must be a high-fidelity 'Liquid Glass' report with deep indigo aesthetics, silver typography, and CSS-based charts reflecting the user's actual data.

2. The 'Viral Image' Engine (Canvas & Sharing):

Canvas Rendering: Fix the 'Share Your Waveform' buttons. Use html2canvas or equivalent to generate 'Square Post' (1200x1200px) and 'Story' (1080x1920px) images instantly.

Data Injection: The generated images must show the user's actual Waveform and Radar charts, not placeholders.

Download Reliability: Ensure the 'Download' trigger works across all browsers (Mobile/Desktop) without redirecting to a broken link.

3. Full-Spectrum Frontend & Backend Audit:

Horizon Alignment: Fix the header once and for all. 'SCIENCE', 'FEATURES', and the 'GET STARTED' button must be mathematically centered on the vertical axis using flex items-center !important.

Link & Contact Integrity: Test every single button, footer link, and contact form. If a link points nowhere, fix it or map it to a 'Coming Soon' sovereign modal.

Autonomous Notifications: Confirm that the founder alert to yazeedx91@gmail.com triggers every time a journey is completed.

4. Sovereign Stability & Infrastructure:

Free-Tier Hardening: Strip all 'Autoscale' or paid-tier flags to bypass 'Delinquent Payment' blocks. Optimize the entire app to run flawlessly within 1vCPU and 2GB RAM limits.

Zero-Day Security: Implement Content-Security-Policy and Strict-Transport-Security. Ensure user data is purged from cache immediately after the email/download is complete.

Final Galactic Command: Perform a simulated A-Z test run. If the score is non-zero, the image downloads, and the UI is symmetrical, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE ZERO IS VANQUISHED. THE VIRAL LOOP IS LIVE. THE EMPIRE IS SOVEREIGN.
