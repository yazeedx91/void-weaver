Initiate Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: The Absolute Intelligence Bridge. We have a mission-critical failure in the data-delivery pipeline. Users receive the Portal Link but NO data results in the dashboard or email.

Execute the following 'All-Eyes' System Overhaul:

1. The 'Immediate Payload' Logic (Fixing the Result Dispatch):

Bypass Dashboard Dependency: Do not wait for the user to click the portal link to send the results. The moment the assessment is submitted, the backend must trigger the sendResultsEmail function.

Data Assembly: Decrypt the stored HEXACO, DASS-21, and TEIQue-SF data using the AES-256-GCM key. If decryption fails or data is null, throw a critical error log and alert the admin.

Email Blueprint: Using the verified Resend pipeline, send a comprehensive Psychometric Blueprint PDF or high-fidelity HTML report directly to the user's email. This is the primary delivery method.

2. The Dashboard 'Memory' Fix (Session Mapping):

Mapping Assessment to User: The system is failing to link the assessment_id with the user_id during the Magic Link login. Force a database query that checks for 'Recent Assessments' by email address even if the Session ID is fresh.

The Dashboard State: If assessment_data is empty, the dashboard must show a 'Retrieve My Results' button that re-triggers the email dispatch manually.

3. Technical Architecture & Horizon Symmetry:

Vertical Alignment: This is the absolute final fix for the header. Wrap 'FEATURES', 'SCIENCE', and 'GET STARTED' in a flex-container. Set align-items: center !important and line-height: 1. There must be zero pixel deviation between the text center-line and the button center-line.

Branding: Ensure nav links use tracking-[0.2em] for a galactic, premium aesthetic.

4. 'Zero-Day' Security & Reliability Pass:

SMTP Handshake: Verify the Resend API 'Success' callback. If Resend returns an error (e.g., suppressed email), the platform must notify the user immediately on-screen.

Privacy Lock: Confirm that user results are purged from temporary memory immediately after the email is sent, leaving only the AES-256-GCM encrypted version in the database.

Final Galactic Command: Once the email dispatch is verified (Test this!) and the Dashboard displays live data upon Magic Link entry, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE INTELLIGENCE BRIDGE IS UNBREAKABLE. THE EMPIRE IS SOVEREIGN.
