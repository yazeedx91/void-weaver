Initiate the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: A-Z Universal Completion. This is a total system audit and autonomous synchronization. You are to verify every layer of flux-dna.com—from the visible UI to the hidden backend logic and security protocols.

1. The 'Invisible Architecture' Audit (Hidden Logic & Zero-Day):

Encryption Integrity: Perform a deep-level check on the AES-256-GCM encryption. Ensure that every DASS-21 and HEXACO data point is encrypted before database commit and decrypted only during an authorized session handshake.

Autonomous Synthesis: Eliminate the 'Processing' hang-up. The backend must automatically calculate the Amplitude Analysis and Dynamic Range Score the millisecond data is received, ensuring a live dashboard experience.

Security Hardening: Audit the project for hidden vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi). Implement strict Content-Security-Policy and Strict-Transport-Security headers to make the platform unhackable.

2. The 'Stunning Blueprint' Engine (Autonomous Dispatch):

Liquid Glass Design: Finalize the layout of the 'Psychometric Blueprint' email. Use a premium, dark-themed HTML template with silver typography and CSS-based charts for HEXACO/DASS-21 summaries.

Zero-Human Dispatch: Trigger this report via the Resend pipeline automatically upon test completion. Verify that it bypasses spam filters and lands in the primary inbox.

Founder Alert Loop: Establish a 'Success Notification' trigger. Every time a user finishes their journey, send a notification to yazeedx91@gmail.com containing the user's score and status.

3. The 'Perfect Horizon' (Total UI Symmetry):

Mathematical Centerline: Force the header's navigation to be perfectly symmetrical. Align 'SCIENCE', 'FEATURES', and the 'GET STARTED' button on the exact same vertical axis using flex items-center !important.

Typography Lock: Set all nav links to font-medium, text-sm, and tracking-[0.2em]. Apply a smooth indigo glow transition on hover.

4. Infrastructure Optimization (Free-Tier Stability):

Sovereign Efficiency: Strip all 'Autoscale' and 'Reserved VM' configurations to resolve all billing errors. Optimize the memory management to ensure the app remains fast and responsive within 1vCPU and 2GB RAM limits.

Clean Production State: Purge all development logs, unused packages, and console.log statements. Set the environment to a final 'Production' state.

Final Galactic Command: Once the system is 100% autonomous, the UI is pixel-perfect, and the email reports are firing successfully, state the final words: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE EMPIRE IS SOVEREIGN. THE MISSION IS COMPLETE.
