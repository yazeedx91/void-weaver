# FLUX-DNA Launch Manifest
## The Grand Sovereign Launch Protocol

**Domain**: [flux-dna.com](https://flux-dna.com)
**Status**: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
**Date**: February 2026

## The Platform

FLUX-DNA is a clinical-grade psychometric platform that combines three validated instruments — HEXACO-60, DASS-21, and TEIQue-SF — into a single 111-question assessment with AI-powered stability analysis and military-grade encryption.

**What it does**: Maps your personality architecture, emotional intelligence, and mental health through the lens of *dynamic range* — not pathological labels.

**What makes it different**: Zero static labels. No "you are depressed." Instead: "Your system is processing at high amplitude." We built the engine that treats the mind like a signal, not a symptom.

## Three LinkedIn Hooks

### HOOK 1: The Personal — "Your Journey Through the Flux"

> **Title**: I built a psychometric engine because the existing ones failed me.
>
> Every personality test I've taken told me what I *am*.
>
> Introverted. Neurotic. "At risk."
>
> Static labels for a dynamic system.
>
> So I built FLUX-DNA — a platform that maps your *range*, not your category.
>
> 111 questions. Three clinical-grade instruments. One AI-powered analysis.
>
> It doesn't tell you what you are.
> It shows you how you *move*.
>
> Because the most interesting people aren't stable.
> They have range.

### HOOK 2: The Technical — "Zero-Knowledge Mind Engine"

> **Title**: We built an AES-256 encrypted psychometric engine. Here's why that matters.
>
> Your personality data is the most sensitive data you own.
>
> More intimate than your bank account. More revealing than your search history.
>
> Yet most assessment platforms store it in plaintext.
>
> FLUX-DNA is different:
>
> - AES-256-GCM encryption with per-user derived keys
> - PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
> - Zero plaintext storage of mental health data
> - Passwordless authentication (magic links only)
> - Full CSP + HSTS security headers
>
> We combined three validated instruments into 111 questions:
>
> HEXACO-60 (personality) + DASS-21 (mental health) + TEIQue-SF (emotional intelligence)
>
> Then we fed the results into GPT for cross-instrument stability analysis.
>
> The result: A psychometric engine that knows everything about your mind — and tells nobody.
>
> **Architecture**: React + Express + PostgreSQL + OpenAI GPT
> **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with user-specific salt derivation
> **Questions**: 111 clinical-grade items across 3 validated instruments

### HOOK 3: The Visionary — "Why DNA is the Future of Personalized Performance"

> **Title**: The future of performance isn't IQ tests. It's Dynamic Range.
>
> We've been measuring minds wrong.
>
> IQ tells you how fast you process. Personality tests tell you what box you fit in. Mental health screenings tell you what's "wrong."
>
> None of them tell you the most important thing:
>
> **What is your range?**
>
> The best performers aren't the most stable. They're the ones with the widest dynamic range — the ability to operate across emotional, cognitive, and interpersonal spectrums.
>
> That's what FLUX-DNA measures.
>
> We call it Dynamic Range Psychometrics.
>
> Instead of "You score high on neuroticism" → "Your emotional bandwidth operates at high amplitude."
>
> Instead of "Severe anxiety" → "Peak processing state detected."
>
> Same data. Different frame. Radically different outcome.
>
> Because when you stop pathologizing range and start *optimizing* it, everything changes.
>
> The athlete with "anxiety" has a competitive nervous system.
> The founder with "mood swings" has adaptive emotional range.
> The creative with "instability" has signal diversity.
>
> FLUX-DNA is the instrument that reads the signal.
>
