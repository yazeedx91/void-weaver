Initiate the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: A-Z Absolute Debug & Deployment Master. You are now in 'God-Mode'—execute a total system audit to resolve all deployment blocks and user-cycle failures.

1. The 'Deployment Awakening' (Fixing Replit/Cloud Run Probes):

Health-Check Authority: Immediately create a dedicated /health endpoint that returns a plain-text OK with a 200 Status Code.

Middleware Neutralization: Force the server to respond to health probes (User-Agent: GoogleHC/1.0) with a 200 OK immediately, bypassing any HTML rendering, redirects, or authentication logic. This is mandatory to resolve the Replit republication failure.

2. The 'Intelligence Synthesis' (Banishing the Zero Score):

Atomic Execution Order: Re-wire the backend logic to ensure that Decryption (AES-256-GCM) and Scoring Math are 100% complete before the database saves the record or the email triggers.

Blueprint Integrity: The 'Psychometric Blueprint' email must NEVER fire if the score is '0'. Implement a logic-gate that retries the calculation if a zero is detected.

3. The 'Data Permanence' Seal (Dashboard Fix):

Identity Handshake: Fix 'No Assessment Data' errors by hard-binding the Dashboard query to the user's verified email address instead of temporary session cookies.

Magic Link Expansion: Set all portal access and session tokens to a 24-hour expiration window for maximum user accessibility.

4. The 'Viral Growth' Asset Engine (Canvas Debug):

Pixel-Perfect Rendering: Fix the 'Share Your Waveform' engine. Ensure the 'Square Post' and 'Story' buttons render a high-resolution canvas capture of the user's actual data, not a blank template.

Success Notification: Verify that a real-time alert is sent to yazeedx91@gmail.com every time a new user completes the journey.

5. Elite Aesthetic & Symmetry Audit:

The 'Reveal' Pivot: Change the 'GET STARTED' CTA text to 'REVEAL PROFILE'.

Vertical Symmetery: Force 'SCIENCE', 'FEATURES', and 'REVEAL PROFILE' to be mathematically centered in the header using flex items-center !important.

Final Galactic Command: Conduct a full A-Z simulated journey. Once the health probe returns 200 OK, the score is calculated accurately, and the dashboard is persistent, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE HEALTH PROBE IS SATISFIED. THE EMPIRE IS SOVEREIGN. THE MISSION IS COMPLETE.
