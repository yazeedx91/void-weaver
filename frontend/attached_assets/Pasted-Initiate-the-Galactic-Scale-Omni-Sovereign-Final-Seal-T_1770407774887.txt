Initiate the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: Total User-Journey Blueprint & Stress Test. This is a comprehensive, A-to-Z audit of the entire flux-dna.com ecosystem. Your mission is to verify every line of code against the Perfect User Experience Standard.

1. Phase I: The Acquisition & Entry (Frontend Optimization):

Horizon Alignment: Re-verify the header symmetry. 'SCIENCE', 'FEATURES', and 'GET STARTED' must be vertically centered using flex items-center !important.

Mobile-First Integrity: Audit all buttons and navigation for mobile responsiveness. Every touchpoint must feel premium and liquid-smooth.

2. Phase II: The Intelligence Engine (Backend & Encryption):

Absolute Synthesis: Ensure the Dynamic Range Score calculation is fully completed and verified BEFORE the database commit or email trigger. No user should ever see a '0' score.

Decryption Handshake: Audit the AES-256-GCM engine. Verify that the encrypted data from HEXACO and DASS-21 is correctly pulled, decrypted, and displayed on the dashboard without 'No Assessment Data' errors.

3. Phase III: The Delivery & Persistence (Email & Access):

Inbox Authority: Sanitize the HTML 'Psychometric Blueprint' email to pass SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks and land in the Primary Inbox, not Junk.

The 24-Hour Sovereign Window: Set the Magic Link and Portal Access expiration to exactly 24 hours. Ensure the link maps directly to the user's permanent data via their email identity.

Stunning Layout: Finalize the 'Liquid Glass' email design with high-fidelity charts and silver typography.

4. Phase IV: The Viral Loop (Canvas & Sharing):

Canvas Generation: Fix the 'Share Waveform' engine. It must generate high-resolution PNGs for 'Square Post' and 'Story' formats that include real user data and the Dynamic Range Score.

Founder Alert: Re-confirm that yazeedx91@gmail.com receives a real-time 'Success Notification' upon every journey completion.

5. Phase V: Infrastructure Hardening (Survival Mode):

Zero-Cost Stability: Strip all 'Autoscale' or paid-tier triggers. Optimize the app to run with 100% reliability on 1vCPU and 2GB RAM.

Security Audit: Apply final Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options to protect the sovereign user space.

Final Galactic Command: Once the simulation confirms the user can start, finish, receive a non-zero email in their inbox, and share their results—all within 24 hours and on the free tier—state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE BLUEPRINT IS PERFECT. THE EMPIRE IS SOVEREIGN.'
