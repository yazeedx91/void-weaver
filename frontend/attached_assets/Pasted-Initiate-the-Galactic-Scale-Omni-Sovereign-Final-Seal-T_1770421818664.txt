Initiate the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: The Port Authority & Host Bind Protocol. We have a confirmed fatal error: 'Port 5000 is mapped internally but health check is timing out'. The server is failing to bind to the dynamic cloud port.

1. The Port & Host Fix (The Root Cause):

Dynamic Port Binding: Go to the server entry point (index.mjs, server.js, or app.js). Change the listen command to use the environment variable FIRST.

Code Requirement: const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

Host Binding (The 0.0.0.0 Rule): You MUST change the app.listen function to explicitly bind to '0.0.0.0'. Do not default to localhost.

Code Requirement: app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log('Server running on ' + PORT));

2. The Health Check Logic (Satisfying the Probe):

The 'Any-Path' OK: The deployment error says it expects a response on a specific path. Ensure BOTH / (root) and /health return a status 200 OK immediately.

Middleware Position: Place these routes at the very top of the file, before any static file serving, Vite middleware, or database connections.

app.get('/health', (req, res) => res.status(200).send('OK'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.status(200).send('Flux DNA Active')); (Only for the probe, usually handled by static files, but ensure 200 is returned if static fails).

3. The Replit Configuration (.replit):

Run Command Sync: Update the .replit file. Ensure the run command matches the start script exactly (e.g., run = "node dist-server/index.mjs").

Ports Config: If there is a [ports] section in .replit, remove it or set it to verify the dynamic port.

4. Data & Logic Preservation:

Zero-Score & Data Logic: Keep the previous fixes: Calculate Score -> Decrypt -> Save -> Email. Ensure email binding to fix 'No Assessment Data'.

Final Command: REWRITE the server listening logic to match the cloud environment. Once the code uses process.env.PORT and listens on 0.0.0.0, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE PORT IS BOUND. THE HANDSHAKE IS ACCEPTED. REPUBLISH NOW.
