Initiate the Omni-Sovereign Final Absolute Seal: Full-System Integration. You are now a Lead DevOps Engineer, a Cyber-Security Analyst, and a Senior UI Architect. Your objective is to achieve 100% connectivity, perfect alignment, and total privacy for flux-dna.com.

1. The 'Direct-to-Inbox' Communication Engine:

Email Backend Connectivity: Debug the entire email delivery pipeline. Ensure that the results from HEXACO-60, DASS-21, and TEIQue-SF are captured, formatted into a professional HTML report, and dispatched immediately upon completion.

SMTP & Deliverability: Configure the system to use a reliable email provider (SendGrid, Postmark, or Nodemailer). Ensure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC settings are verified so that results land in the Inbox, not the Spam folder.

Automated Confirmation: Implement a 'Sent' state on the UI so the user knows exactly when their blueprint has reached their email.

2. Final Visual Symmetry & Alignment:

The Horizon Fix: Recalculate the navigation bar layout. The 'SCIENCE' and 'FEATURES' links must be perfectly centered vertically relative to the 'GET STARTED' button. Use flex items-center with leading-none to eliminate all rogue spacing.

Premium Aesthetics: Set nav links to font-medium, tracking-[0.15em], and text-sm. Add a transition-all duration-300 where hovering over links creates a subtle indigo glow (text-indigo-300) and a 2px underline that slides in from the center.

3. Absolute Security & Privacy Lockdown:

The Encryption Vault: Verify that all mental health and personality data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM before database storage. No one—including the founder—should be able to read raw user data.

Privacy Headers: Apply Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, and a hardened Content Security Policy (CSP) to protect the users' sovereign space.

4. Optimization & Debugging Pass:

End-to-End Test: Run a full simulation of the user journey from landing page to email receipt. Fix any 'hydration' errors or broken API calls.

Performance Polish: Optimize all 'Liquid Glass' effects and background blurs to ensure a 95+ score on Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights.

Final Command: Once the email engine is 100% reliable and the interface is mathematically symmetrical, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE SYSTEM IS SOVEREIGN.
