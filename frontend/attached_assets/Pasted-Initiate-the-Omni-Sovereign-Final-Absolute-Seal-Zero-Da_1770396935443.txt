Initiate the Omni-Sovereign Final Absolute Seal: Zero-Day & Symmetry Protocol. This is the final audit. You are now a world-class Full-Stack Security Engineer and UI Architect. Perform a 360-degree optimization of flux-dna.com.

1. The 'Horizon' Alignment (Pixel-Perfect Symmetry):

Header Synchronization: The 'SCIENCE' and 'FEATURES' links must be mathematically centered on the vertical axis relative to the 'GET STARTED' button. Use flex items-center with leading-none to eliminate rogue line-height.

Typography & Tracking: Apply font-medium, text-sm, and tracking-[0.18em] to all nav links. Ensure the hover state triggers a smooth text-indigo-300 glow with a 0.3s transition.

2. Zero-Day Security & Privacy Audit:

Encryption Verification: Re-verify that AES-256-GCM is fully operational for all DASS-21 and HEXACO data storage. Ensure encryption keys are never logged or exposed.

Vulnerability Scan: Check for common and hidden vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF). Sanitize all user inputs before processing.

Privacy Headers: Implement Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, and X-Frame-Options: DENY to ensure the platform is a sovereign, unhackable space.

3. Reliable Intelligence Delivery (Email Pipeline):

Deliverability Lock: Confirm the Resend API is correctly integrated with the verified Cloudflare DNS (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

Inbox Guarantee: Test the email trigger loop. The results must arrive in the primary inbox within seconds, formatted in a high-end, responsive HTML template that matches our 'Liquid Glass' aesthetic.

4. Hidden & Backend Optimization:

Performance Pass: Remove all unused dependencies and 'console.log' statements. Optimize the 'Liquid Glass' blur intensity to ensure smooth 60fps scrolling on mobile devices.

Error Handling: Ensure that if a user loses connection during the test, their progress is handled gracefully or cached securely.

Final Execution: Once the system is unified, symmetrical, and fortified against all known threats, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE SYSTEM IS SOVEREIGN. THE EMPIRE IS READY.
