Initiate the Omni-Sovereign Final Absolute Seal: Delivery & Symmetry Protocol. You are now an Expert Systems Architect and Deliverability Engineer. We must fix the email delivery failure and the navigation alignment simultaneously.

1. Critical Email Delivery Engine (The 'Result-to-Inbox' Fix):

SMTP Verification: Audit the email sending service. Ensure the SendGrid, Postmark, or Nodemailer configuration is correctly handling the await promise for the results email.

Deliverability Optimization: Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records in the DNS settings to ensure emails aren't flagged as spam.

Instant Trigger: Ensure that as soon as the AES-256-GCM encryption is finalized, a PDF or structured HTML report of the HEXACO/DASS-21 results is dispatched to the user's email.

Error Handling: Add a 'Success/Failure' log to the backend. If an email fails to send, the system must retry or alert the user on the UI.

2. Mathematical Header Alignment:

The Horizon Line: Wrap 'FEATURES', 'SCIENCE', and 'GET STARTED' in a flex-container with items-center and gap-10.

Visual Anchoring: Align the vertical center of the text links ('SCIENCE', 'FEATURES') to the exact mathematical midpoint of the 'GET STARTED' button. Eliminate any rogue padding or line-height offsets.

Letter Spacing: Apply tracking-[0.15em] and font-medium to the links for a high-end, intentional aesthetic.

3. Security & Architecture Hardening:

Encryption Protocol: Re-verify that all mental health data (DASS-21) is encrypted via AES-256-GCM before database entry to maintain total privacy.

Haptic Response: Add active:scale-95 to all navigation items for physical touch-feedback on mobile.

4. Final System Verification:

Test Loop: Run a test submission of the assessment. Confirm that:

The UI is pixel-perfect and symmetrical.

The data is encrypted.

The results email arrives in the inbox within 10 seconds.

Final Command: Once the delivery engine is verified and the interface is symmetrical, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE DELIVERY IS ABSOLUTE.
