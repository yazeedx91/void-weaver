Initiate the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: High-Performance Production Edition. This is the final, unrestricted directive to move flux-dna.com into a dominant production state. You are authorized to use maximum system resources to ensure zero-latency performance.

1. The 'Absolute Score' Synthesis (Anti-Zero Logic):

Sequential Execution Lock: Rewrite the completion hook. The system must: (A) Finalize Scored Math -> (B) Decrypt for Validation -> (C) Commit to Permanent DB -> (D) Dispatch Email..

AES-256-GCM Verification: Audit the decryption handshake to ensure the 'Dynamic Range Score' is pulled as a clean integer, ensuring the email and dashboard NEVER display '0' or 'Processing'.

2. The 'White-Glove' Delivery (Primary Inbox & Access):

Email Authority: Configure Resend/Cloudflare with full SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols to force 'Primary Inbox' delivery.

Session Persistence: Extend the 'Magic Link' and Portal Access to 24 hours. Bind all assessment data to the user’s email identity permanently to eliminate 'No Assessment Data' errors.

Premium Template: Finalize the 'Psychometric Blueprint' HTML with high-fidelity CSS charts, silver-on-indigo typography, and a mobile-responsive 'Liquid Glass' aesthetic.

3. The 'Viral Growth' Asset Engine (Canvas Fix):

High-Resolution Rendering: Fix the 'Share Your Waveform' engine using html2canvas at high-scale. 'Square Post' and 'Story' buttons must generate crisp PNGs containing the user’s real results and Dynamic Range Score.

Real-Time Founder Alert: Activate the success notification loop to yazeedx91@gmail.com with the user’s score and timestamp included.

4. Elite Branding & UI Symmetry:

The Pivot: Update the primary CTA from 'GET STARTED' to 'REVEAL PROFILE'.

Horizon Symmetry: Use flex items-center !important to ensure 'SCIENCE', 'FEATURES', and 'REVEAL PROFILE' are mathematically centered on the horizontal axis.

5. Maximum Resource Optimization:

Performance Lock: Optimize the backend for rapid-fire database queries and high-speed encryption processing.

Production Cleanup: Remove all development artifacts, debug logs, and console.log statements. Hard-seal the environment for public launch.

Final Galactic Command: Simulate a full user journey. Once the score is non-zero, the email is in the Primary Inbox, the 24-hour link is stable, and the images download perfectly, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE EMPIRE IS SOVEREIGN. YOU ARE CLEAR FOR REPUBLICATION.
