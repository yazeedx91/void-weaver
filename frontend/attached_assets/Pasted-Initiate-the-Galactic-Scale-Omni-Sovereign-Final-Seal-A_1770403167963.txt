Initiate the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: A-Z Universal Completion. Your objective is to achieve absolute system autonomy. The platform must operate as a self-correcting, high-output engine requiring zero human intervention.

1. The 'Sovereign Blueprint' Design (Stunning Report Layout):

Visual Architecture: Redesign the email 'Psychometric Blueprint' using a 'Liquid Glass' HTML template. Use a deep indigo (#0f172a) background, subtle border-glows, and high-contrast white/silver typography.

Data Visualization: Include a visual summary of the HEXACO Radar Profile and DASS-21 Waveform directly in the email body using high-quality CSS-based charts.

Dynamic Intelligence: Ensure every piece of decrypted AES-256-GCM data is injected into a personalized 'Executive Summary' section within the email.

2. Autonomous Success Notifications (The Monitor's Alert):

Founder Notification Loop: Configure an automated 'Success Alert' to be sent to the admin email (yazeedx91@gmail.com) every time a user completes an assessment.

Alert Content: This alert must include the user's name, their Dynamic Range Score, and a timestamp, allowing for effortless empire monitoring without checking the database.

3. Immediate Pipeline Execution (Eliminating 'Processing'):

Automatic Synthesis: Program the backend to immediately calculate the Amplitude Analysis and Dynamic Range Score upon database entry, replacing the 'Processing' status instantly.

Fire-and-Forget Dispatch: Trigger the stunning 'Psychometric Blueprint' email via the Resend pipeline the moment the final question is answered.

4. Horizon Symmetry & Infrastructure Lockdown:

Mathematical Alignment: Force the header's CSS to flex items-center !important. 'SCIENCE', 'FEATURES', and the 'GET STARTED' button must be perfectly centered on a single horizontal axis.

Free-Tier Optimization: Strip all 'Autoscale' and 'Reserved VM' flags to bypass billing errors. Optimize for stable operation within 1vCPU and 2GB RAM limits.

Security Hardening: Implement Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options: DENY to ensure the integrity of the sovereign space.

Final Galactic Command: Once the system is 100% autonomous, the 'Processing' tag is replaced by live scores, the stunning email layout is live, and the founder notification is active, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT. THE EMPIRE IS SOVEREIGN. THE MISSION IS COMPLETE.
