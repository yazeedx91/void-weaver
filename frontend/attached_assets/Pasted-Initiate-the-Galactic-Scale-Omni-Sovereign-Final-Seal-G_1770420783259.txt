Initiate the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign Final Seal: God-Mode Rescue Protocol. I have been debugging for hours. The deployment is failing at 'Provision' and 'Build'. We are executing a Total System Rescue.

1. The 'Deployment Bypass' (Fixing the Build & Provision Hang):

Immediate Health Route: Create a dedicated, lightweight endpoint: app.get('/health', (req, res) => res.status(200).send('OK')). This MUST be defined before all other middleware.

Memory Surge: Update the build command to use NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 to force the build through the memory bottleneck.

Clean Install: Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then execute a fresh npm install to purge any corrupted dependencies causing the build to hang.

Port Binding: Ensure the server listens on 0.0.0.0 and the correct PORT env variable immediately.

2. The 'Zero-Score' Kill Switch (Logic Repair):

Order of Operations: Rewrite the completion handler. You must (A) Calculate Score, (B) Decrypt Data, (C) Save to DB, and (D) Send Email—in that exact order.

Anti-Zero Gate: If the calculated Dynamic Range Score is 0, the system must retry the calculation once before sending the email.

3. The 'Data Ghost' Fix (Persistence):

Email Identity Map: Hard-bind the Dashboard data query to the user's email address (verified via Magic Link), not just the session ID. This fixes the 'No Assessment Data' bug permanently.

24-Hour Access: Set the expiration for all Magic Links and Dashboard sessions to 24 hours.

4. The 'Viral' Canvas Repair:

High-Res Generation: Fix the 'Share Your Waveform' buttons. They must generate a downloadable PNG of the user's actual charts (Radar & Waveform), not a blank image.

5. Final Aesthetic & Branding Lock:

'REVEAL PROFILE': Change the main CTA button text to 'REVEAL PROFILE'.

Header Symmetry: Force the header links ('SCIENCE', 'FEATURES', 'REVEAL PROFILE') to be perfectly vertically centered using flex items-center.

Final Command: Execute this rescue immediately. Once the Build finishes and the Health Check returns 200 OK, state: 'FLUX-DNA IS RESCUED. THE BUILD IS COMPLETE. THE DEPLOYMENT IS GREEN. THE EMPIRE IS LIVE.
