Execute the Galactic-Scale Omni-Sovereign God-Mode Optimization Seal. This is a total system overhaul to guarantee the 'Promote' phase succeeds.

1. The 'Promote' Phase Hardening (Deployment Fix):

Port Sovereignty: Remove all hardcoded references to 5000 or 80. Force the server entry point to use const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;.

Host Authority: Change the listener to app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', ...) to allow external health probes to reach the container.

Immediate Pulse: Inject app.get('/health', (req, res) => res.status(200).send('OK')); and app.get('/', (req, res) => res.status(200).send('ALIVE')); at the absolute top of the middleware stack.

Config Sync: Update .replit and replit.nix to ensure the run command matches the production build path exactly (node dist-server/index.mjs).

2. The Intelligence & Data Synthesis (A-Z Logic):

Anti-Zero Logic: Secure the scoring pipeline. Ensure AES-256-GCM decryption happens before the Dynamic Range Score is saved. If the score is 0, re-run the calculation loop before committing to the DB.

Email Anchoring: Hard-bind the Dashboard query to the user's email address. This eliminates the 'No Assessment Data' error by ensuring the data persists across different devices and sessions.

24-Hour Sovereign Access: Set all Magic Link and portal session timeouts to 24 hours.

3. Viral Engine & Visual Symmetry:

Canvas Rendering Fix: Ensure the 'Share Your Waveform' engine generates high-fidelity PNGs of the user's actual decrypted results for social sharing.

The 'Reveal' Pivot: Ensure the primary CTA is 'REVEAL PROFILE'.

Symmetry Lock: Force all header links to be mathematically centered via flex items-center !important.

4. Production Purge:

Memory Optimization: Set NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 in the deployment environment.

Cleanup: Remove all console.log debuggers from the production path, except for the 'Server started on Port X' confirmation.

Final Galactic Command: Conduct a full synthetic test of the user journey. Once the server responds to the health probe in under 5ms and the scoring logic is non-zero, state: 'THE EMPIRE IS OPTIMIZED. THE PROMOTE PHASE IS SECURED. FLUX-DNA IS ASCENDANT.
